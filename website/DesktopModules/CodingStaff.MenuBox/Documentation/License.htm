    <p>
        <span class="quote">This CodingStaff End-User Software License Agreement is a 
        legal agreement between you (either as an individual user, corporation or single 
        entity) and CodingStaff for a product which includes computer software, and may 
        include associated media, printed materials, and online or electronic 
        documentation. By exercising your rights to install the SOFTWARE PRODUCT, you 
        agree to be bound by the terms of this EULA, including the limitations and 
        warranty disclaimers.<br />
        <br />
        If you do NOT agree to the terms of this EULA, please return the SOFTWARE 
        PRODUCT and immediately destroy all copies of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT in your 
        possession.<br />
        <br />
        SOFTWARE PRODUCT LICENSE<br />
        <br />
        The SOFTWARE PRODUCT is protected by copyright laws and international copyright 
        treaties, as well as other intellectual property laws and treaties.<br />
        <br />
        1. GRANT OF LICENSE.<br />
        <br />
        This is a license agreement, and NOT an agreement for sale. CodingStaff retains 
        ownership of the copy of THE SOFTWARE in your possession, and all copies you may 
        be licensed to make. CodingStaff retains all rights not expressly granted to you 
        in this LICENSE. CodingStaff hereby grants to you, and you accept, a 
        non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use, copy and modify THE SOFTWARE 
        only as authorized below.<br />
        <br />
        Provided that you have accepted the terms contained herein, this EULA grants you 
        the following rights:<br />
        <br />
        A) If you purchased a SINGLE PORTAL LICENSE: You are granted a license to 
        install the SOFTWARE PRODUCT on a single production web server, and use it for a 
        SINGLE DotNetNuke portal. You are also permitted to use the same license for 
        non-production development or staging servers.<br />
        <br />
        B) If you purchased a HOST LICENSE: You are granted a license to install the 
        SOFTWARE PRODUCT on a single production web server, and use it for a SINGLE 
        DotNetNuke host installation (instance). You are also permitted to use the same 
        license for non-production development or staging servers.&nbsp;
        <br />
        <br />
        C) If you purchased an UNLIMITED LICENSE WITH SOURCE CODE: You are granted a 
        license for a single developer (individual) within your organization to 
        distribute the SOFTWARE PRODUCT royalty-free with an unlimited number of ASP.NET 
        applications to an unlimited number of web servers, provided they are developed 
        solely by that developer. At no time may the SOFTWARE PRODUCT be used by more 
        than one individual at the same time for development purposes -- nor may the 
        SOFTWARE PRODUCT be distributed for use with applications other than those 
        developed by her/him. Any application with which the SOFTWARE PRODUCT is 
        distributed must add significant functionality to the SOFTWARE PRODUCT and must 
        not contain the same, or substantially the same, functionality as any Aricie 
        product. You are further licensed to view the source code of the SOFTWARE 
        PRODUCT and modify it for use as described above. Under no circumstances may the 
        source code or products developed by using the source code be re-distributed in 
        any form.<br />
        <br />
        You are required to ensure that the SOFTWARE PRODUCT is not distributed in any 
        form that allows it to be reused by any application other than that with which 
        you distribute it. For example, if you install an ASP.NET control along with a 
        packaged application on a customer&#39;s server, that customer is not permitted to 
        use the control independent of your application.<br />
        <br />
        D) For All Licenses: Regardless of the type of license purchased, if the 
        SOFTWARE PRODUCT includes reusable software such as controls, components, 
        plug-ins, stylesheets, etc. you may not use any of these independently of the 
        SOFTWARE PRODUCT.<br />
        <br />
        In no case shall you rent, lease, lend, redistribute nor re-license THE SOFTWARE 
        PRODUCT or source code to a 3rd party individual or entity, except as outlined 
        above. In no case shall you grant further redistribution rights for THE SOFTWARE 
        PRODUCT to the end-users of your solution.<br />
        <br />
        2. DESCRIPTION OF OTHER RIGHTS AND LIMITATIONS.<br />
        <br />
        Termination. Without prejudice to any other rights, CodingStaff may terminate 
        this EULA if you fail to comply with the terms and conditions of this EULA. In 
        such event, you must destroy all copies of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT and all of its 
        component parts, source code, associated documentation, and related materials.<br />
        <br />
        3. COPYRIGHT.<br />
        <br />
        All title and copyrights in and to the SOFTWARE PRODUCT (including but not 
        limited to any images,photographs, animations, video, audio, music, text, and 
        applets incorporated into the SOFTWARE PRODUCT), the accompanying printed 
        materials, and any copies of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT are owned by CodingStaff 
        except for certain portions for which CodingStaff has obtained redistribution 
        rights from the title or copyright holder. The SOFTWARE PRODUCT is protected by 
        U.S. copyright laws and international treaty provisions. Therefore, you must 
        treat the SOFTWARE PRODUCT like any other copyrighted material.<br />
        <br />
        4. LIMITED WARRANTY.<br />
        <br />
        NO WARRANTIES. CodingStaff expressly disclaims any warranty for the SOFTWARE 
        PRODUCT. The SOFTWARE PRODUCT and any related documentation is provided &quot;as is&quot; 
        without warranty of any kind, either express or implied, including, without 
        limitation, the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular 
        purpose, or non-infringement. The entire risk arising out of use or performance 
        of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT remains with you.<br />
        <br />
        5. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.<br />
        <br />
        NO LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. In no event shall CodingStaff or its 
        distributors be liable for any damages whatsoever (including, without 
        limitation, damages for loss of business profits, business interruption, loss of 
        business information, or any other financial loss) arising out of the use of or 
        inability to use this CodingStaff product (THE SOFTWARE PRODUCT) and related 
        materials, even if CodingStaff has been advised of the possibility of such 
        damages. Because some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of 
        liability for consequential or incidental damages, the above limitation may not 
        apply to you.<br />
